# Examples and Testers Projects for LoneJS

Every folder starting with an **underscore** `_` is it's own projects that ***SHARES*** the same loneJS-Lib. Changes made to the the loneJS-lib folder can be tested against other examples easily here.

All docs for each example are combined and placed in the docs folder.

### Tester

The tester folder will conceptually replace the old 'cronenberg' folder/project and be used the recreate errors and issues as they come up. The foundation of the tester project is the same as the Page Handling project.

### development with tester, Examples and the loneJS site

It is possible to run http-server at this directory’s level and use the folder’s endpoints to jump around every project within the folder. If you hit ‘localhost:8080’ in your url, you’ll see every projects folder.
